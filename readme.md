# Calculator project (homework 1)

2 calculators, simple one and "long expressions" one.

## Simple

1. Input first number (use "." as decimal delimeter);
2. Press operator button (+, -, *, etc);
3. Input second number (see p.1);
4. Press `=` button (any other operator will do the same result);
5. "C" button clears the input (and both variables and operator).

## Calculator mk2

I thought, simple calculator is not a very interesting thing...

1. Using number buttons and operator buttons, input some expression (for example, '10-2+(3-1)*5/3.1415');
2. Press `=` button.
2.1. Program will check parenthesis (and message will appear if there are any problem with them);
2.2. Expression will be translated into "reverse form" (our example will be converted to '10 2 - 3 1 - 5 * 3.1415 / +');
2.3. And reverse form will be calculated into result (11.1832 in our case).
3. Clear button clears all 3 fields.

## Afterwords

- Variables (simple calculator) and expression (mk2) user can input manually, using keyboard or Ctrl+V.
